# brestprog

Lections on competitive programming topics currently hosted at
[neocities](http://brestprog.neocities.org/).

The site is currently undergoing rewrite, the major points are
automatic tests for code listings and improved design. 

## Building

To build this site locally you need to have Ruby (with RubyGems)
installed. Then, install the Bundler gem (`gem install bundler`),
and use it to install the site dependencies (`bundler install`).

To run a local server with built contents, use `jekyll serve`.
